Of course I`m aware about embedding abilities of original Konsole, but once I had Qt without KDE, and it was a serious problem. I decided not to rely on a chance. I could not find any interesting related project, so I had to write it. The original Konsole`s code was rewritten entirely with QT4 only; also I have to include in the project some parts of code from kde core library. All code dealing with user interface parts and session management was removed (maybe later I bring it back somehow), and the result is quite useful, I suppose."
